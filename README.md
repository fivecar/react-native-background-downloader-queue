Todo:
* Replace all "ryansonshine" with "fivecar"
* Replace all "my-package" with your package name
* Add NPM_TOKEN as a secret in the new repo
* Use branches for changes you don't plan to launch. As soon as you merge to main, it'll release onto NPM.

## Install

```bash
npm install my-package
```
or

yarn add my-package
